# Studioworks Core
**Control Ableton Live using natural language via AI assistants like Claude, Cursor, or any MCP-compatible tool. Studioworks Core provides a robust Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that translates natural language commands into precise actions within your Ableton Live session.**

## Key Features

This project provides comprehensive, programmatic control over the Ableton Live environment.

* **Session and Transport Control:**
    * Start and stop playback.
    * Get session info, including tempo, time signature, and track count.
    * Manage scenes: create, delete, rename, and fire.

* **Track Management:**
    * Create, rename, and get detailed information for MIDI and audio tracks.
    * Control track properties: volume, panning, mute, solo, and arm.
    * Manage track grouping and folding states.

* **MIDI Clip and Note Manipulation:**
    * Create and name MIDI clips with specified lengths.
    * Add, delete, transpose, and quantize notes within clips.
    * Perform batch edits on multiple notes in a single operation.
    * Adjust clip loop parameters and follow actions.

* **Device and Parameter Control:**
    * Load instruments and effects from Ableton's browser by URI.
    * Get a full list of parameters for any device on a track.
    * Set and batch-set device parameters using normalized values (0.0 to 1.0).

* **Automation and Envelopes:**
    * Add and clear automation points for any device parameter within a clip.
    * Get information about existing clip envelopes.

* **Browser Integration:**
    * Navigate and list items from Ableton's browser.
    * Load instruments, effects, and samples directly from a browser path or URI.
    * Import audio files directly into audio tracks or clip slots.

* **AI Production Skills**
    * 12 built-in skills as slash commands: groove-builder, chord-pro, tempo-coach,
      arrangement-coach, genre-edm-production, automation-coach, and more
    * Invoke with /groove-builder, /chord-pro, /arrangement-coach etc. in Claude Code
    * Skills encode genre-specific patterns, MIDI maps, mix balance defaults

##  Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Prerequisites
- Ableton Live 11+ (any edition)
- Python 3.10 or higher
- Claude Desktop or Cursor IDE

### 1. **Get the Code**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mumumedia/studioworks-core.git
cd studioworks-core
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate          # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e .
```

### 2. **Install Ableton Script**
1. Find your Ableton User Library Remote Scripts folder:
   - **Windows**: `C:\Users\[You]\Documents\Ableton\User Library\Remote Scripts\`
   - **Mac**: `~/Music/Ableton/User Library/Remote Scripts/`
2. Create folder: `AbletonMCP`
3. Copy `AbletonMCP_Remote_Script/__init__.py` into this folder

### 3. **Configure Ableton**
1. Open Ableton Live
2. Go to **Preferences** → **Link, Tempo & MIDI**
3. Set **Control Surface** to "AbletonMCP"
4. Set Input/Output to "None"

### 4. **Connect AI Assistant**

**For Claude Desktop:**

🍎 macOS:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "AbletonMCP": {
      "command": "python3",
      "args": ["/path/to/studioworks-core/MCP_Server/server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```
> If using a virtual environment: replace `python3` with `/path/to/studioworks-core/.venv/bin/python`

🪟 Windows:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "AbletonMCP": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["C:\\path\\to\\studioworks-core\\MCP_Server\\server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

**For Cursor:**
Add MCP server in Settings → MCP with the same path.

### 5. **Start Creating!** 
Open your AI assistant and try:
- *"Create a new MIDI track with a piano"*
- *"Add a simple drum beat"*
- *"What tracks do I currently have?"*

## How It Works

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[You: Natural Language] --> B[AI Assistant]
    B --> C[MCP Server]
    C --> D[Ableton Remote Script]
    D --> E[Ableton Live API]
    E --> F[🎵 Your Music]
```

1. You issue a command in plain English to your AI assistant (e.g., "Create a new MIDI track and name it 'Bass'").
2. The AI Assistant understands the intent and calls the appropriate tool from the MCP server.
3. The MCP Server (server.py) receives the tool call and constructs a specific JSON command.
4. The Ableton Remote Script (__init__.py), running inside Live, receives the JSON command via a socket connection.
5. The Remote Script executes the command using the official Ableton Live API, making the change in your session instantly.
